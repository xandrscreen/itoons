Build an "iTunes like" web application that allows for the following:

- Browse songs by title, artist, album, year, genre. 
- Edit song metadata (at least title, artist, album, year, genre, rating and album artwork).
- Playlists management workflow (create, edit, delete).
- Import/export the song database (you pick the format).

Bonus points:

- Search songs with auto complete (i.e. get a list of songs by an author as you type his/her name).
- Smart playlists.

Things we look for in the code:

- Component based design.
- Testability (no need for 100% test coverage but it should be reasonably easy to build unit and integration tests for it).
- Simplicity.
- Nice look and feel (no need to reinvent the wheel here, stock component libraries are ok).
